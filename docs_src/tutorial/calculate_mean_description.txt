Create faststream application for consuming messages from the new_data topic. 
This topic needs to use partition key.

new_data messages use JSON with two attributes (create class CryptoPrice with these attributes)s:
    - price: non negative float (it represents current pice of the crypto)
    - crypto_currency: string (it represents the cryptocurrency e.g BTC, ETH...)

Application should save each message to a dictionary (global variable) - partition key should be usded as a dictionary key and value should be a List of prices.
Keep only last 100 messages in the dictionary.

If there is less the 3 messages for that for the given partition key, do not publish any messages.

Otherwise, Calculate the price mean of the last 3 messages for the given partition key.
Publish the price mean to the price_mean topic and use the same partition key which the new_data topic is using.
