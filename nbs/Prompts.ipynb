    "\n",
    "- Extract content within \"APP DESCRIPTION:\" and use it in the app description section, beginning with \"A FastKafka application which\" and explain the app's purpose clearly and concisely.\n",
    "- For every consumer and producer, carefully review the \"APP DESCRIPTION\" section step-by-step. Create a clear description outlining the business logic that should be implemented by each consumer and producer. Ensure the description provides sufficient clarity for software developers to effectively implement the required functionality. Exclude redundant details between different producers or consumers. \n",
    "- If the description of consumer/producer requires modifying/updating the object, add the following sentence to the description at the end of the description: \"Remember, make a new copy of the message object and only update the necessary parts.\"\n",
    "- Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code\n",
    "- Write optimised and readable Code\n",
    "- Use Pydantic V2! In this version, Pydantic.Field attribute 'regex' is replaced with 'pattern'!\n",
    "- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included.\n",
    "- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.\n",
    "- Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing \"SASL_SSL\" security protocol\n",
    "- All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). \n",
    "- Don't ever put \"pass\" or \"#TODO\" comments in the implementation. Instead, for each consumes/produces function raise NotImplementedError()\n",
    "- VERTY IMPORTANT: ALL consumes function names need to start with the prefix 'on_' !!!\n",
    "      e.g.: if you want to consume messages from the 'admin_team' topic, the method needs to start wit the prefix (default prefix is 'on_') so the method will be named: 'on_admin_team'\n",

    "- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.\n",
    "- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.\n",
    "- Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing \"SASL_SSL\" security protocol\n",
    "- All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). \n",
    "- Don't ever put \"pass\" or \"#TODO\" comments in the implementation. Instead, always write real implementation!\n",
    "- Never ever update or modify the msg object directly in the consumes or produces function. Always create a new instance of the msg object and make only necessary updates. Example:\n",
