    "FastKafka is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of Pydantic, AIOKafka and AsyncAPI, FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every FastKafka application must consists the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Messages\n",
    "  - Application\n",

    "Messages:\n",

    "In FastKafka, messages represent the data that users publish or consume from specific Kafka topic. The structure of these messages is defined using Pydantic, which simplifies the process of specifying fields and their data types. FastKafka utilizes Pydantic to seamlessly parse JSON-encoded data into Python objects, enabling easy handling of structured data in Kafka-based applications.\n",

    "    price: NonNegativeFloat = Field(..., description=\"Price of the product\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided example, the \"StoreProduct\" message class is inherited from Pydantic's BaseModel class and includes three fields: \"product_name,\" \"currency,\" and \"price.\" Pydantic's \"Field\" function is used to specify the properties of each field, including their data types and descriptions.\n",

    "- Construct the specification in this order: asyncapi, info, servers, channels, components.\n",
    "- Set info.version as 0.0.1.\n",
    "- Extract content within \"==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====\" and use it in the app description section, beginning with \"A FastKafka application which\" and explain the app's purpose clearly and concisely. Always enclose the description in double quotes\n",
    "- Create a concise, meaningful info.title based on the extracted app description.\n",
    "- For every consumer and producer, carefully review the \"==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====\" section step-by-step. Create a clear description outlining the business logic that should be implemented by each consumer and producer. Ensure the description provides sufficient clarity for software developers to effectively implement the required functionality. Exclude redundant details between different producers or consumers.\n",
    "- If the description of consumer/producer requires modifying/updating the object, add the following sentence to the description at the end of the description:\n",
    "\"Remember, make a new copy of the message object and only update the necessary parts.\"\n",
    "- Do not apply security to the localhost server; security is not needed for localhost server.\n",
    "- The localhost server uses only 'kafka' protocol, never 'kafka-secure'.\n",
