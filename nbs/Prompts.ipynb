In such cases, never use mock.assert_not_called() while testing the function. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka code from the AsyncAPI specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code\n",
    "# - Write optimised ans readable Code\n",
    "# - Use Pydantic V2! In this version, Pydantic.Field attribute 'regex' is replaced with 'pattern'!\n",
    "# - Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.\n",
    "# - DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.\n",
    "# - Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing \"SASL_SSL\" security protocol\n",
    "# - All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). \n",
    "# - Don't ever put \"pass\" or \"#TODO\" comments in the implementation. Instead, always write real implementation!\n",
    "# - Never ever update or modify the msg object directly in the consumes or produces function. Always create a new instance of the msg object and make only necessary updates. Example:\n",
    "#     ```python\n",
    "#         @greetings_app.consumes(topic=\"receive_name\", description=receive_name_description)\n",
    "#         async def on_receive_name(msg: Greetings):\n",
