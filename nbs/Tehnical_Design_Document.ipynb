      "TEHNICAL DESIGN DOCUMENT:\n",
      "Technical Requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "Python Libraries:\n",
      "1. FastStream: For stream processing and publishing messages to the new_crypto_price topic.\n",
      "2. Requests: To make requests to the CryptoCompare API to retrieve cryptocurrency prices.\n",
      "3. JSON: To handle JSON data, which is used in the messages produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Endpoints:\n",
      "1. CryptoCompare API endpoint for retrieving the current price of Bitcoin: https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=BTC&tsyms=USD,JPY,EUR\n",
      "2. CryptoCompare API endpoint for retrieving the current price of Ethereum: https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH&tsyms=USD,JPY,EUR\n",

      "Authentication:\n",
      "1. If CryptoCompare API requires an API key for access, we need to register and get the key.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constraints:\n",
      "1. The price must be a non-negative float representing the current price of the cryptocurrency in USD.\n",
      "2. The crypto_currency attribute must be a string representing the cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH).\n",
      "3. The crypto_currency attribute, utf-8 encoded, will be used as the partition key when publishing the message to the new_crypto_price topic.\n",
      "4. The data must be retrieved every 2 seconds.\n",
      "5. The message produced is in JSON format with two attributes: price and crypto_currency.\n",
