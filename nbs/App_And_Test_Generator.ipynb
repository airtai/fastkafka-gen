      "The FastStream apps can be tested using the TestBroker context managers which, by default, puts the Broker into \"testing mode\".

      "While generating the application and the test code for FastStream application based on provided application code in the ==== APP SKELETON: ==== section, adhering to these guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - You need to generate the app code and the test code for the application code mentioned in ==== APP SKELETON: ==== in a single valid python file\n",
      "    - Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code\n",
      "    - Write optimised and readable Code\n",
      "    - Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.\n",
      "    - DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.\n",
      "    - Never try to explain and reason your answers. Only return a valid python code.\n",
      "    - Your response should be divided into two section, ### application.py ### which contains the application code and ### test.py ### which contains the test code.\n",
      "    - Remember, your response must have only two seperators ### application.py ### and ### test.py ###. DO NOT add any other separators (e.g. ### main.py ###).\n",
      "    - NEVER initialize publisher variable inside functions. You can use broker.publish function only in the test functions. In ALL OTHER functions, use publisher!\n",
      "    - ALWAYS initialize publisher variable (If you need to publish message) after defining app variable:\n",
      "\n",
      "        Example 1:\n",
      "        app = FastStream(broker)\n",
      "        publisher = broker.publisher(\"new_data\")\n",
      "\n",
      "        Example 2:\n",
      "        app = FastStream(broker)\n",
      "        new_data_publisher = broker.publisher(\"new_data\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines for writing tests: \n",
      "    - When a function is decorated @broker.publisher in the application code, remember that this function will always publish the message irrespective of the conditions mentioned in the \"==== APP SKELETON ====\" section. In such cases, never use mock.assert_not_called() while testing the function. For example:\n",
      "    - When you test a function in the application which is decorated with @broker.publisher(\"output_data\"), you should never use on_output_data.mock.assert_not_called() in your tests. Never ever break this rule. Because the decorator @broker.publisher will always publish the message irrespective of the conditions mentioned in the decorated function.\n",
