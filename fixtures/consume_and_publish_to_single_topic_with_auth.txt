Develop a Faststream application that consumes messages from the "new_data" Kafka topic. The messages in the "new_data" topic are structured as JSON and contain a single attribute:

word: string
Upon receiving a message in the "new_data" topic, extract the word from the message. If the word contains spaces, replace the spaces with "+" and make a GET request to "https://api.datamuse.com/words?ml={word}".

The response from this API is a JSON-encoded string that represents a list of dictionaries. Loop through the response and extract the "word" attribute from each dictionary, creating a list of similar words.

Finally, publish the list containing similar words to the "similar_words" Kafka topic for further processing.

The communication with the Kafka broker is encrypted with SSL, and it uses SASL Scram256 for authorization. The username and password required for authorization are loaded from environment variables.

The Faststream application should efficiently handle message consumption, API requests, and message publishing while ensuring secure communication and proper authorization with the Kafka broker. It should continuously process incoming words, find similar words, and make them available for downstream consumers on the "similar_words" topic.
