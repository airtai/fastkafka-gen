Develop a Faststream application that consumes messages from the "new_data" Kafka topic. The messages in the "new_data" topic are structured as JSON and contain a single attribute:

- word: string

Upon receiving a message in the "new_data" topic, extract the word from the message. If the word contains spaces, replace the spaces with "+" and make a GET request to "https://api.datamuse.com/words?ml={word}".

The response from this API is a JSON-encoded string that represents a list of dictionaries. Calculate the length of this response. If the length is greater than 3, publish the top 3 matches to the "top_word_matches" Kafka topic and the rest to the "other_word_matches" Kafka topic. If the length is 3 or less, publish the entire list to the "top_word_matches" Kafka topic.

The communication with the Kafka broker is encrypted with SSL, and it uses SASL SPlaintext for authorization. The username is "admin" and password is "password".

The Faststream application should efficiently handle message consumption, API requests, and message publishing, ensuring that it categorizes and publishes the word matches appropriately to the "top_word_matches" and "other_word_matches" topics for downstream consumers to analyze and process.
