Develop a Faststream application that simultaneously consumes messages from both the "hello" and "world" Kafka topics.

The messages in both the "hello" and "world" topics are formatted as JSON and contain a single attribute:

word: string

Upon receiving a message from both the "hello" or "world" topic, extract the word from the message. Combine the extracted words from both topics using the "+" operator and make a GET request to "https://api.datamuse.com/words?ml={combined_word}".

The API response is a JSON-encoded string that represents a list of dictionaries. Iterate through the response and extract the "word" attribute from each dictionary, generating a list of similar words.

Finally, publish the list containing similar words to two separate Kafka topics, namely "similar_words_email" and "similar_words_sms," to facilitate further processing.

The Faststream application should be designed for efficient message consumption, API requests, and message publishing. It should maintain continuous processing of incoming words, discovering similar words, and making them accessible to downstream consumers via the "similar_words_email" and "similar_words_sms" topics.
