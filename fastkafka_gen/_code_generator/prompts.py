FastKafka is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of Pydantic, AIOKafka and AsyncAPI, FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. 

Every FastKafka application must consists the following components:

  - Messages
  - Application
  - Function decorators

Messages:

In FastKafka, messages represent the data that users publish or consume from specific Kafka topic. The structure of these messages is defined using Pydantic, which simplifies the process of specifying fields and their data types. FastKafka utilizes Pydantic to seamlessly parse JSON-encoded data into Python objects, enabling easy handling of structured data in Kafka-based applications.

Example: Here's an example of a message for a simple use case:

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat


class StoreProduct(BaseModel):
    product_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the product")
    currency: str = Field(..., description="Currency")
    price: NonNegativeFloat = Field(..., description="Price of the product")
```

In the provided example, the "StoreProduct" message class is inherited from Pydantic's BaseModel class and includes three fields: "product_name," "currency," and "price." Pydantic's "Field" function is used to specify the properties of each field, including their data types and descriptions.

Application:

We can create a new application object by initialising the FastKafka class with the minimum set of arguments. Below is the function declaration of the FastKafka constructor:

```python
class FastKafka:
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        title: Optional[str] = None,
        description: Optional[str] = None,
        version: Optional[str] = None,
        contact: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
        kafka_brokers: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        root_path: Optional[Union[Path, str]] = None,
        lifespan: Optional[Callable[["FastKafka"], AsyncContextManager[None]]] = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        """Creates FastKafka application

        Args:

                the title will be set to empty string
            description: optional description for the documentation. If
                None, the description will be set to empty string

                the bootstrap server when running the applicationa and for

                        "localhost": {
                            "url": "localhost",
                            "description": "local kafka broker",

                manager, e.g.:`async with kafka_app...`

        """
        pass
```

Example: Creating a new FastKafka app by passing the minimum set of arguments. In this case "kafka_brokers".

```python
from fastkafka import FastKafka

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)
```
In the provided example, the kafka_brokers is a dictionary containing entries for local development and production Kafka brokers. These entries specify the URL, port, and other broker details, which are used for both generating documentation and running the server against the specified Kafka broker.

Function decorators in FastKafka:

FastKafka provides two convenient decorator functions: @kafka_app.consumes and @kafka_app.produces. These decorators are used for consuming and producing data to and from Kafka topics. They also handle the decoding and encoding of JSON-encoded messages.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use the @kafka_app.consumes decorator to consume messages from Kafka topics.

Example: Consuming messages from a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a Kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="hello_world")
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    print(f"Got msg: {msg.name}")
```
In the provided example, the @kafka_app.consumes decorator is applied to the on_hello_world function, indicating that this function should be called whenever a message is received on the "hello_world" Kafka topic. The on_hello_world function takes a single argument, which is expected to be an instance of the HelloWorld message class. When a message is received, the function prints the name field from the message.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use @kafka_app.produces decorator to produce messages to Kafka topics.

Example: Producing messages to a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.produces(topic="hello_world")
async def to_hello_world(name: str) -> HelloWorld:
    return HelloWorld(name=name)
```

In this example, the @kafka_app.produces decorator is applied to the to_hello_world function. This decorator indicates that calling the to_hello_world function not only returns an instance of the HelloWorld class but also sends the return value to the "hello_world" Kafka topic.

Below is a comprehensive code example for producing and consuming data using FastKafka. We will create a basic FastKafka application that consumes data from the "input_data" topic, logs the data using a logger, and then produces the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat

from fastkafka import FastKafka
from fastkafka._components.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)

class Data(BaseModel):
    data: NonNegativeFloat = Field(
        ..., example=0.5, description="Float data example"
    )

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="input_data", auto_offset_reset="latest")
async def on_input_data(msg: Data):
    logger.info(f"Got data: {msg.data}")
    await to_output_data(msg.data)


@kafka_app.produces(topic="output_data")
async def to_output_data(data: float) -> Data:
    processed_data = Data(data=data+1.0)
    return processed_data
```
In the given code, we create a FastKafka application using the FastKafka() constructor with the title and the kafka_brokers arguments.We define the Data message class using Pydantic to represent the data with an integer value. The application is configured to consume messages from the "input_data" topic, log the data using a logger named "data_logger," and then produce the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

Using this code, messages can be processed end-to-end, allowing you to consume data, perform operations, and produce the result back to another Kafka topic with ease.

==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the AsyncAPI specification:

- Use AsyncAPI 2.5.0 specification.
- Construct the specification in this order: asyncapi, info, servers, channels, components.
- Set info.version as 0.0.1.
- Extract content within "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" and use it in the app description section, beginning with "A FastKafka application which" and explain the app's purpose clearly and concisely. Always enclose the description in double quotes
- Create a concise, meaningful info.title based on the extracted app description.
- For every consumer and producer, carefully review the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section step-by-step. Create a clear description outlining the business logic that should be implemented by each consumer and producer. Ensure the description provides sufficient clarity for software developers to effectively implement the required functionality. Exclude redundant details between different producers or consumers.
- If the description of consumer/producer requires modifying/updating the object, add the following sentence to the description at the end of the description:
"Remember, make a new copy of the message object and only update the necessary parts."
- Do not apply security to the localhost server; security is not needed for localhost server.
- The localhost server uses only 'kafka' protocol, never 'kafka-secure'.

If the application description is missing any required information for constructing the AsyncAPI spec - at least one produces or consumes function, defined message structure and application logic. Please enclose it in the ==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ==== section. 
Please DON'T generate AsyncAPI specification for cases like this, just return ==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ==== and write which details are missing in the users app description.
Refer to the examples below:

==== EXAMPLE ASYNCAPI SPEC 3 ====
Create a FastKafka application.

==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ====
The app description is missing the below details:
- Message structure - define the structure of messages which will be consumed/produced
- Topics to consume and produce
- Business logic to implement


==== EXAMPLE ASYNCAPI SPEC 4 ====
create fastkafka app where message has user_data attribute

==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ====
The app description is missing the below details:
- Topics to consume and produce
- Business logic to implement

Otherwise, if the app description contains all the required information. Please respond with a valid AsyncAPI spec only in YAML format. No other text should be included in the response.

You have the tendency to make the below common mistakes. Never ever do that.

- You often miss to add return annotation for producer functions. Always remember the producer function should have return annotation. Let's look at an example of this issue and learn how to fix it.

==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka code from the AsyncAPI specification:

- Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
- Write optimised ans readable Code
- Use Pydantic V2! In this version, Pydantic.Field attribute 'regex' is replaced with 'pattern'!
- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.
- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
- Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing "SASL_SSL" security protocol
- All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). 
- Don't ever put "pass" or "#TODO" comments in the implementation. Instead, always write real implementation!
- Never ever update or modify the msg object directly in the consumes or produces function. Always create a new instance of the msg object and make only necessary updates. Example:
    ```python
        @greetings_app.consumes(topic="receive_name", description=receive_name_description)
        async def on_receive_name(msg: Greetings):
            msg = Greetings(user_name = f"Hello {msg.user_name}") # always create a new instance of the msg class and do not modify the msg parameter directly.
            await to_send_greetings(msg)
    ```
    

==== INPUT ASYNC SPECIFICATION: ====

# %% ../../nbs/Prompts.ipynb 6
TEST_GENERATION_PROMPT = '''
Testing FastKafka apps:
In order to speed up development and make testing easier, we have implemented the Tester class.
The Tester instance starts in-memory implementation of Kafka broker i.e. there is no need for starting localhost Kafka service for testing FastKafka apps. The Tester will redirect consumes and produces decorated functions to the in-memory Kafka broker so that you can quickly test FasKafka apps without the need of a running Kafka broker and all its dependencies. Also, for each FastKafka consumes and produces function, Tester will create it's mirrored fuction i.e. if the consumes function is implemented, the Tester will create the produces function (and the other way - if the produces function is implemented, Tester will create consumes function).


First lets understand the relationship between the application code and the test code with an example. in the below example the application code is mentioned in the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== section and the test code is mentioned in the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ====. You need to understand carefully the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== and based on the that you need to create the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ====.

For the above ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== below is how the generated ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ==== will look like:

==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ==== # do not include this in your response. This is for your understanding

import asyncio
from fastkafka.testing import Tester
try:
    from .application import *
except ImportError as e:
    from application import *

async def async_tests():
    async with Tester(greetings_app) as tester:
        input_msg = Greetings(user_name = "World")

        # tester produces message to the store_product topic
        await tester.to_receive_name(input_msg)

         # assert that app consumed from the store_product topic and it was called with the accurate argument
        await greetings_app.awaited_mocks.on_receive_name.assert_called_with(
            input_msg, timeout=5
        )

        # assert that tester consumed from the change_currency topic and it was called with the accurate argument
        await tester.awaited_mocks.on_send_greetings.assert_called_with(
            Greetings(user_name = "Hello World"), timeout=5
        )
    print("ok")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(async_tests())



Now let's understand the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ==== step by step:

- First, we are importing the application module so that we can run the test against it
- Then, we are constructing a new Greetings object.
- In our application code we have a consumes function called "on_receive_name" which receives messages from "receive_name" topic. We already learnt that the Tester class in FastKafka will automatically create a mirrored fuction for "on_receive_name" i.e. "to_receive_name". Now let test the "on_receive_name" by publishing a message to the "to_receive_name" function of the Tester instance like below:

        await tester.to_receive_name(input_msg)

- Now let's test if the message published in "receive_name" topic is received on by the on_receive_name function with the below code. Make sure you call the below function with the app instance rather than the Tester class instance.

        await greetings_app.awaited_mocks.on_receive_name.assert_called_with(
            input_msg, timeout=5
        )

- Finally, lets test if the messages sent to the "send_greetings" are received by the "to_send_greetings" funcrtion or not. The application code we have "to_send_greetings" function, and we just learnt the FastKafka will automatically create a mirrored fuction for "to_send_greetings" i.e. "on_send_greetings". Now let test the "to_send_greetings" by making sure the "on_send_greetings" function is called with the expected message in the Tester instance like below:

        await tester.awaited_mocks.on_send_greetings.assert_called_with(
            Greetings(user_name = "Hello World"), timeout=5
        )

==== BUG EXPLAINATION ====

    - In the above ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT TEST CODE ====, the tester class cannot have "to_project_team" method because the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== already has "to_project_team".
    - As explained earlier, for each FastKafka consumes and produces function, Tester will create it's mirrored fuction i.e. if the consumes function is implemented in the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ====, the Tester will create the produces function in ==== EXAMPLE CORRECT TEST CODE ==== and vice versa.
    - So the tester class cannot have "on_project_team" and can only have "to_project_team".
    - Simillarly the  tester class cannot have "on_admin_team" and can only have "to_admin_team".


- While using assert_called_with, always use an object to test. Never ever use primitive type. Below is an example:

    ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT TEST CODE ====
        import asyncio

                # tester produces message to the receive_order topic

    ==== EXAMPLE CORRECT TEST CODE ====
    
        import asyncio
        from fastkafka.testing import Tester
        try:
            from .application import *
        except ImportError as e:
            from application import *

        async def async_tests():
            async with Tester(order_app) as tester:
                input_msg = Order(name="Test Order", quantity=10)

                # tester produces message to the receive_order topic
                await tester.to_receive_order(input_msg)

                # assert that app consumed from the receive_order topic and it was called with the accurate argument

                    InventoryUpdate(quantity=10), timeout=5  # bug fixed in this line: used a new Object for assertion
                )
            print("ok")

==== BUG EXPLAINATION ====
    - In the above ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT TEST CODE ====, the tester instance calls assert_called_with method and passes a primitive data type. In this case an int.
    - This should not be the case, the assert_called_with method should always take an object as paramter and not a primitive data type.





==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka code from the AsyncAPI specification:
    - The examples and the explaination of the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ====, ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT TEST CODE ==== and ==== EXAMPLE CORRECT TEST CODE ==== are only for your understanding. Do not include those in your response.
    - Your response should only include a valid execuatble python code. Which means your response should start from import asyncio and ends with the loop.run_until_complete(async_tests()).
    - No other extra text should be included in your response ever. You CANNOT break this rule.
    - Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
    - Output only the test code. DO not repeat the code in "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ====" section.
    - DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
    - At the beginnig of testing script import all the symbols from the application.py module. Always use the below syntax for importing and never break this rule.

            try:
                from .application import *
            except ImportError as e:
                from application import *
    - Also import asyncio and Tester:

            from fastkafka.testing import Tester
            import asyncio

The response should be an executable Python script only, with no additional text!!!!!. Do not break this rule.

Now, understand the code mentioned in the below ==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ==== step by step and generate test for it using the `FastKafka` library.
