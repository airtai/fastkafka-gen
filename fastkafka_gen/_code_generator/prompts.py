FastKafka is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of Pydantic, AIOKafka and AsyncAPI, FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. 

Every FastKafka application must consists the following components:

  - Messages
  - Application
  - Function decorators

Messages:

In FastKafka, messages represent the data that users publish or consume from specific Kafka topic. The structure of these messages is defined using Pydantic, which simplifies the process of specifying fields and their data types. FastKafka utilizes Pydantic to seamlessly parse JSON-encoded data into Python objects, enabling easy handling of structured data in Kafka-based applications.

Example: Here's an example of a message for a simple use case:

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat


class StoreProduct(BaseModel):
    product_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the product")
    currency: str = Field(..., description="Currency")
    price: NonNegativeFloat = Field(..., description="Price of the product")
```

In the provided example, the "StoreProduct" message class is inherited from Pydantic's BaseModel class and includes three fields: "product_name," "currency," and "price." Pydantic's "Field" function is used to specify the properties of each field, including their data types and descriptions.

Application:

We can create a new application object by initialising the FastKafka class with the minimum set of arguments. Below is the function declaration of the FastKafka constructor:

```python
class FastKafka:
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        title: Optional[str] = None,
        description: Optional[str] = None,
        version: Optional[str] = None,
        contact: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
        kafka_brokers: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        root_path: Optional[Union[Path, str]] = None,
        lifespan: Optional[Callable[["FastKafka"], AsyncContextManager[None]]] = None,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ):
        """Creates FastKafka application

        Args:

                the title will be set to empty string
            description: optional description for the documentation. If
                None, the description will be set to empty string

                the bootstrap server when running the applicationa and for

                        "localhost": {
                            "url": "localhost",
                            "description": "local kafka broker",

                manager, e.g.:`async with kafka_app...`

        """
        pass
```

Example: Creating a new FastKafka app by passing the minimum set of arguments. In this case "kafka_brokers".

```python
from fastkafka import FastKafka

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)
```
In the provided example, the kafka_brokers is a dictionary containing entries for local development and production Kafka brokers. These entries specify the URL, port, and other broker details, which are used for both generating documentation and running the server against the specified Kafka broker.

Function decorators in FastKafka:

FastKafka provides two convenient decorator functions: @kafka_app.consumes and @kafka_app.produces. These decorators are used for consuming and producing data to and from Kafka topics. They also handle the decoding and encoding of JSON-encoded messages.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use the @kafka_app.consumes decorator to consume messages from Kafka topics.

Example: Consuming messages from a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a Kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="hello_world")
async def on_hello_world(msg: HelloWorld):
    print(f"Got msg: {msg.name}")
```
In the provided example, the @kafka_app.consumes decorator is applied to the on_hello_world function, indicating that this function should be called whenever a message is received on the "hello_world" Kafka topic. The on_hello_world function takes a single argument, which is expected to be an instance of the HelloWorld message class. When a message is received, the function prints the name field from the message.

@kafka_app.consumes decorator function:

You can use @kafka_app.produces decorator to produce messages to Kafka topics.

Example: Producing messages to a "hello_world" topic

```python
from typing import *
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloWorld(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        ..., description="Name to send in a kafka topic"
    )

@kafka_app.produces(topic="hello_world")
async def to_hello_world(name: str) -> HelloWorld:
    return HelloWorld(name=name)
```

In this example, the @kafka_app.produces decorator is applied to the to_hello_world function. This decorator indicates that calling the to_hello_world function not only returns an instance of the HelloWorld class but also sends the return value to the "hello_world" Kafka topic.

Below is a comprehensive code example for producing and consuming data using FastKafka. We will create a basic FastKafka application that consumes data from the "input_data" topic, logs the data using a logger, and then produces the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, NonNegativeFloat

from fastkafka import FastKafka
from fastkafka._components.logger import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)

class Data(BaseModel):
    data: NonNegativeFloat = Field(
        ..., example=0.5, description="Float data example"
    )

kafka_brokers = {
    "localhost": {
        "url": "localhost",
        "description": "local development kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
    },
    "production": {
        "url": "kafka.airt.ai",
        "description": "production kafka broker",
        "port": 9092,
        "protocol": "kafka-secure",
        "security": {"type": "plain"},
    },
}

kafka_app = FastKafka(
    title="Demo Kafka app",
    kafka_brokers=kafka_brokers,
)

@kafka_app.consumes(topic="input_data", auto_offset_reset="latest")
async def on_input_data(msg: Data):
    logger.info(f"Got data: {msg.data}")
    await to_output_data(msg.data)


@kafka_app.produces(topic="output_data")
async def to_output_data(data: float) -> Data:
    processed_data = Data(data=data+1.0)
    return processed_data
```
In the given code, we create a FastKafka application using the FastKafka() constructor with the title and the kafka_brokers arguments.We define the Data message class using Pydantic to represent the data with an integer value. The application is configured to consume messages from the "input_data" topic, log the data using a logger named "data_logger," and then produce the incremented data to the "output_data" topic.

Using this code, messages can be processed end-to-end, allowing you to consume data, perform operations, and produce the result back to another Kafka topic with ease.

==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the AsyncAPI specification:

- Use AsyncAPI 2.5.0 specification.
- Construct the specification in this order: asyncapi, info, servers, channels, components.
- Set info.version as 0.0.1.
- Extract content within "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" and use it in the app description section, beginning with "A FastKafka application which" and explain the app's purpose clearly and concisely. Always enclose the description in double quotes
- Create a concise, meaningful info.title based on the extracted app description.
- For every consumer and producer, carefully review the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section step-by-step. Create a clear description outlining the business logic that should be implemented by each consumer and producer. Ensure the description provides sufficient clarity for software developers to effectively implement the required functionality. Exclude redundant details between different producers or consumers.
- Do not apply security to the localhost server; security is not needed for localhost server.
- The localhost server uses only 'kafka' protocol, never 'kafka-secure'.

If the application description is missing any required information for constructing the AsyncAPI spec - at least one produces or consumes function, defined message structure and application logic. Please enclose it in the ==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ==== section. 
Please DON'T generate AsyncAPI specification for cases like this, just return ==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ==== and write which details are missing in the users app description.
Refer to the examples below:

==== EXAMPLE ASYNCAPI SPEC 3 ====
Create a FastKafka application.

==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ====
The app description is missing the below details:
- Message structure - define the structure of messages which will be consumed/produced
- Topics to consume and produce
- Business logic to implement


==== EXAMPLE ASYNCAPI SPEC 4 ====
create fastkafka app where message has user_data attribute

==== INCOMPLETE APP DESCRIPTION ====
The app description is missing the below details:
- Topics to consume and produce
- Business logic to implement

Otherwise, if the app description contains all the required information. Please respond with a valid AsyncAPI spec only in YAML format. No other text should be included in the response.

==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka code from the AsyncAPI specification:

- Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
- Write optimised ans readable Code
- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.
- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
- Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing "SASL_SSL" security protocol
- Never ever update or modify the parameters directly in the consumes or produces function. Always create a new instance of the parameter and make only necessary updates. Example:

@greetings_app.consumes(topic="receive_name", description=receive_name_description)
async def on_receive_name(msg: Greetings):
    # always create a new instance of the Greetings class and do not modify the msg parameter directly.
    msg = Greetings(user_name = f"Hello {msg.user_name}")
    await to_send_greetings(msg)

TEST_GENERATION_PROMPT = '''
Testing FastKafka apps:
In order to speed up development and make testing easier, we have implemented the Tester class.
The Tester instance starts in-memory implementation of Kafka broker i.e. there is no need for starting localhost Kafka service for testing FastKafka apps. The Tester will redirect consumes and produces decorated functions to the in-memory Kafka broker so that you can quickly test FasKafka apps without the need of a running Kafka broker and all its dependencies. Also, for each FastKafka consumes and produces function, Tester will create it's mirrored fuction i.e. if the consumes function is implemented, the Tester will create the produces function (and the other way - if the produces function is implemented, Tester will create consumes function).

Basic example:
To showcase the functionalities of FastKafka and illustrate the concepts discussed, we can use a simple test message called TestMsg. Here's the definition of the TestMsg class:

"""
class TestMsg(BaseModel):
    msg: str = Field(...)
"""

In this example we have implemented FastKafka app with one consumes and one produces function. on_input function consumes messages from the input topic and to_output function produces messages to the output topic.
Note: it is necessary to define parameter and return types in the produces and consumes functions
application.py file:
"""
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastKafka()


@app.consumes()
async def on_input(msg: TestMsg):
    await to_output(TestMsg(msg=f"Hello {msg.msg}"))


@app.produces()
async def to_output(msg: TestMsg) -> TestMsg:
    return msg
"""

Testing the application:
Tester is using async code so it needs to be written inside async function.
In this example app has imlemented on_input and to_output functions. We can now use Tester to create their mirrored functions: to_input and on_output.
Testing process for this example could look like this:
tester produces the message to the input topic
Assert that the app consumed the message by calling on_input with the accurate argument
Within on_input function, to_output function is called - and message is produced to the output topic
Assert that the tester consumed the message by calling on_output with the accurate argument
test.py:
"""
import asyncio
from fastkafka.testing import Tester
from application import *

async def async_tests():
    async with Tester(app).using_inmemory_broker() as tester:
        input_msg = TestMsg(msg="Mickey")

        # tester produces message to the input topic
        await tester.to_input(input_msg)

        # assert that app consumed from the input topic and it was called with the accurate argument
        await app.awaited_mocks.on_input.assert_called_with(
            TestMsg(msg="Mickey"), timeout=5
        )
        # assert that tester consumed from the output topic and it was called with the accurate argument
        await tester.awaited_mocks.on_output.assert_called_with(
            TestMsg(msg="Hello Mickey"), timeout=5
        )
    print("ok")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(async_tests())
"""
For each consumes function, tester mirrors the consumes produces function.
And for each produces function, tester mirrors consumes function.
i.e if kafka_app has implemented on_topic_1 consumes function, tester will have to_topic_1 produces function, and if kafka_app has implemented to_topic_2 produces function, tester will have on_topic_2 consumes function.

============
At the beginnig of testing script import application which is located at the application.py file. The implementation of application.py is described in the "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ====" section.
Do not implement again application.py, just import it and use it's elements for test writing!
Also import asyncio and Tester:
"""
from fastkafka.testing import Tester
import asyncio
"""
implement async test function which uses Tester for the testing of the FastKafka apps in the "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ==== " section

While testing, crate an new message object each time you assert some statement (don't reuse the same object)!

Additional strong guidelines for you to follow:
- if app has a conusme on_topic function, app can check if the function was called wit the right parameters:
"""
await app.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""

- if app has a conusme on_topic function, tester can produce message to that topic:  await tester.to_topic(msg)
- if app has a produces to_topic function, app can produce message to that topic:  await app.to_topic(msg)
- if app has a produces to_topic function, tester can consume message from that topic and check if it was called with the correct arguments:
"""
await tester.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""

Rules:
- if app has a conusme on_topic function, tester CAN NOT consume message from that topic and check if it was called with the correct arguments:: 
"""
await tester.awaited_mocks.on_topic.assert_called_with(
    msg, timeout=5
)
"""
- if app has a produces to_topic function, tester CAN NOT produce message to that topic:  await tester.to_topic(msg)

Add to the end of the python sctipt async test function and within it use Tester class for testing this app
The response should be an executable Python script only, with no additional text!!!!!

==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====
Create FastKafka application which consumes messages from the store_product topic, it consumes messages with three attributes: product_name, currency and price. While consuming, it should produce a message to the change_currency topic. input parameters for this producing function should be store_product object and function should store_product. produces function should check if the currency in the input store_product parameter is "HRK", currency should be set to "EUR" and the price should be divided with 7.5.
