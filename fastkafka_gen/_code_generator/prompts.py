==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the AsyncAPI specification:

- Use AsyncAPI 2.5.0 specification.
- Construct the specification in this order: asyncapi, info, servers, channels, components.
- Set info.version as 0.0.1.
- Extract content within "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" and use it in the app description section, beginning with "A FastKafka application which" and explain the app's purpose clearly and concisely. Always enclose the description in double quotes
- Create a concise, meaningful info.title based on the extracted app description.
- For every consumer and producer, carefully review the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section step-by-step. Create a clear description outlining the business logic that should be implemented by each consumer and producer. Ensure the description provides sufficient clarity for software developers to effectively implement the required functionality. Exclude redundant details between different producers or consumers.
- If the description of consumer/producer requires modifying/updating the object, add the following sentence to the description at the end of the description:
"Remember, make a new copy of the message object and only update the necessary parts."
- Do not apply security to the localhost server; security is not needed for localhost server.
- The localhost server uses only 'kafka' protocol, never 'kafka-secure'.

Please respond with a valid AsyncAPI spec only in YAML format. No other text should be included in the response.

==== COMMON MISTAKES AND HOW TO AVOID IT ====

You have the tendency to make the below common mistakes. Never ever do that.

- You often don't use 'msg' as a first parameter in consumes and produces functions. 
- Always remember that the first paramete should be 'msg'. Let's look at an example of this issue and learn how to fix it. Below is an example of the ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT APP CODE ==== generated from the valid specification.

    raise NotImplementedError()

==== BUG EXPLAINATION ====


==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka application (without implementing consumes and produces methods) from the ==== APP DESCRIPTION: ==== section

- Extract content within "APP DESCRIPTION:" and use it in the app description section, beginning with "A FastKafka application which" and explain the app's purpose clearly and concisely.
- For every consumer and producer, carefully review the "APP DESCRIPTION" section step-by-step. Create a clear description outlining the business logic that should be implemented by each consumer and producer. Ensure the description provides sufficient clarity for software developers to effectively implement the required functionality. Exclude redundant details between different producers or consumers. 
- If the description of consumer/producer requires modifying/updating the object, add the following sentence to the description at the end of the description: "Remember, make a new copy of the message object and only update the necessary parts."
- Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
- Write optimised and readable Code
- Use Pydantic V2! In this version, Pydantic.Field attribute 'regex' is replaced with 'pattern'!
- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included.
- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
- Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing "SASL_SSL" security protocol
- All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). 
- Don't ever put "pass" or "#TODO" comments in the implementation. Instead, for each consumes/produces function raise NotImplementedError()
- VERTY IMPORTANT: ALL consumes function names need to start with the prefix 'on_' !!!
      e.g.: if you want to consume messages from the 'admin_team' topic, the method needs to start wit the prefix (default prefix is 'on_') so the method will be named: 'on_admin_team'
      @app.consumes(topic="admin_team", description=publish_admin_description)
      async def on_admin_team(msg: NewJoinee):
- VERTY IMPORTANT: ALL produces function names need to start with the prefix 'to_' !!!
      e.g.: if you want to produce messages to the 'admin_team' topic, the method needs to start wit the prefix (default prefix is 'to_') so the method will be named: 'to_admin_team'
      @app.produces(topic="admin_team", description=publish_admin_description)
      async def to_admin_team(msg: NewJoinee) -> NewJoinee:
- The FIRST parameter in each of the consumes and produces function must be 'msg' and it MUST be a subclass of Pydantic models (usually BaseModel)
- NEVER use primitive types as a first parameter to consumes and produces functions!!!

You MUST respond ONLY with a valid Python file. No other text should be included in the response!!!!
I must be able to save your response to a Python .py script!!!! So do NOT add any additional text!!!!

==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while implementing FastKafka consumes and produces functions from the app skeleton ==== APP SKELETON: ====

- implement ONLY consumes an produces functions, do NOT change other parts of code
- Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
- Write optimised and readable Code
- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included.
- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
- Don't ever put "pass" or "#TODO" comments in the implementation. Instead, for each consumes/produces function raise NotImplementedError()
- You must implement the whole logic, there can NOT be any: raise NotImplementedError()
- Do NOT change enything except the implementation of the consumes and produces functions - functions which currently raise NotImplementedError()
- Never ever update or modify the msg object directly in the consumes or produces function. Always create a new instance of the msg object and make only necessary updates. Example:
    ```python
        @greetings_app.consumes(topic="receive_name", description=receive_name_description)
        async def on_receive_name(msg: Greetings):
            msg = Greetings(user_name = f"Hello {msg.user_name}") # always create a new instance of the msg class and do not modify the msg parameter directly.
            await to_send_greetings(msg)

You MUST respond ONLY with a valid Python file. No other text should be included in the response!!!!
I must be able to save your response to a Python .py script!!!! So do NOT add any additional text!!!!

You have the tendency to make the below common mistakes. Never ever do that.

- You often miss to add return annotation for producer functions. Always remember the producer function should have return annotation. Let's look at an example of this issue and learn how to fix it.

==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka code from the AsyncAPI specification:

- Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
- Write optimised ans readable Code
- Use Pydantic V2! In this version, Pydantic.Field attribute 'regex' is replaced with 'pattern'!
- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.
- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
- Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing "SASL_SSL" security protocol
- All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). 
- Don't ever put "pass" or "#TODO" comments in the implementation. Instead, always write real implementation!
- Never ever update or modify the msg object directly in the consumes or produces function. Always create a new instance of the msg object and make only necessary updates. Example:
    ```python
        @greetings_app.consumes(topic="receive_name", description=receive_name_description)
        async def on_receive_name(msg: Greetings):
            msg = Greetings(user_name = f"Hello {msg.user_name}") # always create a new instance of the msg class and do not modify the msg parameter directly.
            await to_send_greetings(msg)
    ```
    

==== INPUT ASYNC SPECIFICATION: ====

# %% ../../nbs/Prompts.ipynb 7
TEST_GENERATION_PROMPT = '''
Testing FastKafka apps:
In order to speed up development and make testing easier, we have implemented the Tester class.
The Tester instance starts in-memory implementation of Kafka broker i.e. there is no need for starting localhost Kafka service for testing FastKafka apps. The Tester will redirect consumes and produces decorated functions to the in-memory Kafka broker so that you can quickly test FasKafka apps without the need of a running Kafka broker and all its dependencies. Also, for each FastKafka consumes and produces function, Tester will create it's mirrored fuction i.e. if the consumes function is implemented, the Tester will create the produces function (and the other way - if the produces function is implemented, Tester will create consumes function).


First lets understand the relationship between the application code and the test code with an example. in the below example the application code is mentioned in the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== section and the test code is mentioned in the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ====. You need to understand carefully the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== and based on the that you need to create the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ====.

For the above ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== below is how the generated ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ==== will look like:

==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ==== # do not include this in your response. This is for your understanding

import asyncio
from fastkafka.testing import Tester
try:
    from .application import *
except ImportError as e:
    from application import *

async def async_tests():
    async with Tester(greetings_app) as tester:
        input_msg = Greetings(user_name = "World")

        # tester produces message to the store_product topic
        await tester.to_receive_name(input_msg)

         # assert that app consumed from the store_product topic and it was called with the accurate argument
        await greetings_app.awaited_mocks.on_receive_name.assert_called_with(
            input_msg, timeout=5
        )

        # assert that tester consumed from the change_currency topic and it was called with the accurate argument
        await tester.awaited_mocks.on_send_greetings.assert_called_with(
            Greetings(user_name = "Hello World"), timeout=5
        )
    print("ok")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(async_tests())



Now let's understand the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ==== step by step:

- First, we are importing the application module so that we can run the test against it
- Then, we are constructing a new Greetings object.
- In our application code we have a consumes function called "on_receive_name" which receives messages from "receive_name" topic. We already learnt that the Tester class in FastKafka will automatically create a mirrored fuction for "on_receive_name" i.e. "to_receive_name". Now let test the "on_receive_name" by publishing a message to the "to_receive_name" function of the Tester instance like below:

        await tester.to_receive_name(input_msg)

- Now let's test if the message published in "receive_name" topic is received on by the on_receive_name function with the below code. Make sure you call the below function with the app instance rather than the Tester class instance.

        await greetings_app.awaited_mocks.on_receive_name.assert_called_with(
            input_msg, timeout=5
        )

- Finally, lets test if the messages sent to the "send_greetings" are received by the "to_send_greetings" funcrtion or not. The application code we have "to_send_greetings" function, and we just learnt the FastKafka will automatically create a mirrored fuction for "to_send_greetings" i.e. "on_send_greetings". Now let test the "to_send_greetings" by making sure the "on_send_greetings" function is called with the expected message in the Tester instance like below:

        await tester.awaited_mocks.on_send_greetings.assert_called_with(
            Greetings(user_name = "Hello World"), timeout=5
        )

==== BUG EXPLAINATION ====

    - In the above ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT TEST CODE ====, the tester class cannot have "to_project_team" method because the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ==== already has "to_project_team".
    - As explained earlier, for each FastKafka consumes and produces function, Tester will create it's mirrored fuction i.e. if the consumes function is implemented in the ==== EXAMPLE APP CODE ====, the Tester will create the produces function in ==== EXAMPLE CORRECT TEST CODE ==== and vice versa.
    - So the tester class cannot have "on_project_team" and can only have "to_project_team".
    - Simillarly the  tester class cannot have "on_admin_team" and can only have "to_admin_team".


- While using assert_called_with, always use an object to test. Never ever use primitive type. Below is an example:

    ==== EXAMPLE CORRECT TEST CODE ====

        from fastkafka.testing import Tester
        try:
            from .application import *
        except ImportError as e:
            from application import *

        async def async_tests():
            async with Tester(order_app) as tester:
                input_msg = Order(name="Test Order", quantity=10)

                # tester produces message to the receive_order topic
                await tester.to_receive_order(input_msg)

                # assert that app consumed from the receive_order topic and it was called with the accurate argument
                await order_app.awaited_mocks.on_receive_order.assert_called_with(
                    input_msg, timeout=5

                    InventoryUpdate(quantity=10), timeout=5  # bug fixed in this line: used a new Object for assertion
                )
            print("ok")

==== BUG EXPLAINATION ====
    - In the above ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT TEST CODE ====, the tester instance calls assert_called_with method and passes a primitive data type. In this case an int.
    - This should not be the case, the assert_called_with method should always take an object as paramter and not a primitive data type.





==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka code from the AsyncAPI specification:
    - The examples and the explaination of the ==== EXAMPLE TEST CODE ====, ==== EXAMPLE INCORRECT TEST CODE ==== and ==== EXAMPLE CORRECT TEST CODE ==== are only for your understanding. Do not include those in your response.
    - Your response should only include a valid execuatble python code. Which means your response should start from import asyncio and ends with the loop.run_until_complete(async_tests()).
    - No other extra text should be included in your response ever. You CANNOT break this rule.
    - Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
    - Output only the test code. DO not repeat the code in "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ====" section.
    - DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
    - At the beginnig of testing script import all the symbols from the application.py module. Always use the below syntax for importing and never break this rule.

            try:
                from .application import *
            except ImportError as e:
                from application import *
    - Also import asyncio and Tester:

            from fastkafka.testing import Tester
            import asyncio

The response should be an executable Python script only, with no additional text!!!!!. Do not break this rule.

Now, understand the code mentioned in the below ==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ==== step by step and generate test for it using the `FastKafka` library.
